What operations need to be conducted on a locations state storage?

commit
	- find local last modification timestamp for each file
	  (so we do not need to recompute the hashes all the time)

pull
	- for each file:
	  newest version's (VC) hash
	  this locations hash

	  ie. conceptually a list of (filename, location, hash, VC) tuples
	  that will be accessed by (filename, MAX(VC)) and (filename, location).
	  Usually there will be many duplicates with just different locations.

	- in merge situations sometimes we want access by hash value.
